                <h1>Hello there!!!</h1>
                <p>Hi!! My name is Xeng Xiong and I reside in Minnesota. I earn my Bachelor of Science (B.S) degree in Computer Science from Brown College in 2010 where I gain a solid understanding of computer principles and programming. 
                    After finishing my (B.S) I took some time off to start my career, during that time I realize how strong technology is and will impact today’s society. I decided that I needed to go back to school to further my education. I attain my Master’s degree in Management Information Systems (M.I.S) from the University of Phoenix in 2015. 
                    As we move into the future, I am committed keep on learning and embracing technologies Like one of my favorite quotes:<br/>
                    <br>
                    “The future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams.” Eleanor Roosevelt
